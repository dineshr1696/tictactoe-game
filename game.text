Tic Tac Toe - AI Mode
A fun and intelligent Tic Tac Toe game with AI mode, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The AI is designed to think strategically and make smart moves, not just random guesses.

🚀 Tech Stack Used
Technology	Version Used
HTML	HTML5
CSS	CSS3
JavaScript	ES6+
🧐 What kind of AI is used here?
The AI logic is built using:

✅ Greedy Algorithm
✅ Basic Decision Tree Logic
🤖 How does the AI play smarter?
AI Strategy	What happens internally?
✅ Greedy Algorithm	AI prioritizes the winning move first
✅ Basic Decision Tree Logic	If winning is not possible, AI blocks the player from winning
✅ Random Move	If neither winning nor blocking is possible, AI plays a random safe move
🔍 How Greedy Algorithm + Decision Tree Logic works here:
1️⃣ Greedy Algorithm:
The AI greedily checks for the winning move first (If placing 'O' can make it win, it takes that move immediately).
2️⃣ Basic Decision Tree Logic:
If the winning move is not available, the AI checks all possible moves and blocks the player (X) from winning.
3️⃣ Random Move (Fallback):
If neither winning nor blocking is possible, the AI randomly picks an empty cell.
💡 Why is this AI smarter than normal JavaScript games?
Normal JS Game	This AI Game
Makes random moves	Uses Greedy Algorithm
No strategy to block the player	Uses Decision Tree Logic to block player
No thinking process	AI analyzes the board before every move
